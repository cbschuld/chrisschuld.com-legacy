Based on a comment on the <a href="http://chrisschuld.com/projects/browser-php-detecting-a-users-browser-from-php/">Browser.php</a> page I added support for the iPod today.  I opted to place both the iPhone and iPod as browsers even though they are likely using the same instance of Safari.  Additionally I added support for the iPod and iPhone as platforms.  Thanks for the comments; enjoy!
