+ [ReactJS App/Interface for the Monoprice Six Zone Amp/Controller ](/projects/react-app-for-the-monoprice-six-zone-audio-controller/) - Provides a mobile-centric web app for controlling a multi-zone whole house audio system.  Monoprice sells this inexpensive six zone home audio controller that provides a lot of value for the price point.  [I use two them in my setup](/2019/05/whole-house-audio/) and thus far have had a great experience with them.  You can control them remotely using a JSON API that Jesse Newland created and I have helped expand on. <br/><a class="openSourceLink" href="https://github.com/cbschuld/monoprice-multizone-interface"><i class="fab fa-github"></i> Github</a>

+ [JSON API wrapper for the RS-232 interface of the Monoprice 6 Zone Home Audio Multizone Controller](https://github.com/jnewland/mpr-6zhmaut-api) - Jesse Newland wrote this great API for interfacing with the [six channel multi-zone amplifier from Monoprice](https://www.monoprice.com/product?p_id=10761).  Jesse did not have the keypads and only a single system.  I helped to update it to manage multiple amps, CORS, requery and higher baudrate throughput. <br/><a class="openSourceLink" href="https://github.com/jnewland/mpr-6zhmaut-api"><i class="fab fa-github"></i> Github</a>

+ [KVBA](/projects/kvba/) - A serverless based AWS lambda and api gateway enabled key/value store with Basic HTTP Authorization and weak obfuscated account creation. All keys are partitioned by user scope thus each user maintains their own domain of keys. Cross-Origin resource sharing (CORS) is also available via the serverless to add protection for call origin. <br/><a class="openSourceLink" href="https://github.com/cbschuld/kvba"><i class="fab fa-github"></i> Github</a>

+ [Browser.php](/projects/browser-php-detecting-a-users-browser-from-php/) - (PHP Class to help determine the user's browser) <br/><a class="openSourceLink" href="https://github.com/cbschuld/Browser.php"><i class="fab fa-github"></i> Github</a> <a class="openSourceLink" href="https://packagist.org/packages/cbschuld/browser.php"><i class="fas fa-elephant" aria-hidden="true"></i> Packagist</a>

+ [PSR-3 Compliant PHP Wrapper for Log Entries](https://packagist.org/packages/cbschuld/logentries) - A PHP PSR-3 compliant logging class for LogEntries service [https://logentries.com/](https://logentries.com/) <br/><a class="openSourceLink" href="https://github.com/cbschuld/logentries"><i class="fab fa-github"></i> Github</a> <a class="openSourceLink" href="https://packagist.org/packages/cbschuld/logentries"><i class="fas fa-elephant" aria-hidden="true"></i> Packagist</a>

+ [PegasusPHP](https://github.com/cbschuld/pegasusphp.org) - a PHP Model View Controller Framework - A model view controller framework I wrote for PHP when PHP5 was launched in 2004.  I added it to github in 2011.  It is a legacy framework - there are better choices now but this framework powered a few of my projects through a lot of revenue. **(EOL - no longer maintained)** <br/><a class="openSourceLink" href="https://github.com/cbschuld/pegasusphp.org"><i class="fab fa-github"></i> Github</a>
